RWR/RWS has priority logic: one primary threat, plus a list of secondary
threats.
  The priority-sorted list of threats can influence whether and how a
  threat is display on the RWR scope.

In order from highest to lowest:
1. missile launch 
2. STT or a similar lock mode 
3. common types of threats:
	a. airborne radar 
	b. long range radar 
	c. mid range radar 
	d. short range radar
	e. early warning system 
	f. AWACS radar
4. maximum signal strength

RWS "Radar Warning System" does NOT define the distance to the
emitter. Only received signal strength and priority.

AN/ALR-56C is the RWR "Radar Warning Receiver" portion of the TEWS
"Tactical Electronic Warfare System"

RWR can receive radar signals for a 360* range around the aircraft, in a
90* donut - that is, +/- 180 degrees, +/- 45 degrees elevation. The top
(12 o'clock) of the scope represents directly in front of the aircraft.
Max number of threats on the RWR scope is 16. Threats are shown based
on priority, so if 17 threats are detected, the lowest threat would
not be shown.  Can be in two display modes - show all radar threats,
and show only locked threats.  Distance from the center of the scope
(the center represents the pilot's aircraft), is proportional to the
received signal strength. Priority can also factor into this, as early
warning radars and AWACS radars will not be displayed in the inner circle.
